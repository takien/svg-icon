SVG Icon Loader is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to easily embed SVG icons on your web page without the need to  paste long SVG code. With just a small snippet of code, you can load SVG icons effortlessly.

```html
<svg-icon data-vendor="WordPress/dashicons" data-icon="admin-home"></svg-icon>
```

Make sure to include the SVG Icon Loader JavaScript file in your HTML page before using the snippet. You can do so by adding the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/takien/svg-icon/src/svg-icon.min.js"></script>
```
